My Process

The process involved starting with the basic structure using semantic HTML5 markup, followed by styling the component with CSS. I focused on a mobile-first design, ensuring that the layout was responsive and visually appealing on all screen sizes. I also used CSS custom properties for easier styling customization.

Key Steps:

Set up the HTML structure: I started by creating the basic structure with the QR code, the text, and the attribution.

Styling with CSS: I added custom styles to make the component look clean and modern, including using custom properties for colors and fonts.

Responsive Design: Ensured that the component adapts to different screen sizes, using media queries for both desktop and mobile views.

Continued Development:

I plan to continue improving my web development skills by building more projects like this one. This challenge was helpful for reviewing concepts and familiarizing myself with the Frontend Mentor platform. For the next steps, I aim to work on improving the responsiveness further, experimenting with animations, and exploring more advanced layout techniques.
